KERYMA-XI - The Future of Operating Systems 🚀

📌 Overview

KERYMA-XI is a modern, efficient, and highly optimized operating system designed to deliver superior performance, next-generation security, and advanced support for multiple architectures, including x86_64, ARM64, and RISC-V.

Developed as a lightweight yet robust alternative to Linux and Windows, KERYMA-XI combines a modular architecture, an optimized kernel, and advanced support for applications and developers.

🎯 Key Features

✅ Optimized kernel (low memory and CPU usage).
✅ Modular and extensible architecture.
✅ Multi-architecture support (x86_64, ARM64, RISC-V).
✅ Modern file systems (Btrfs, ZFS, NTFS, exFAT, FUSE).
✅ Advanced power management (CPU scaling, hibernation).
✅ Optimized networking stack (IPv6, TLS in Kernel, WireGuard).
✅ Virtualization and containers (KVM/QEMU, Docker, GPU passthrough).
✅ Next-generation security (Zero Trust, TPM 2.0, memory encryption).
✅ Drivers for modern hardware (NVMe, PCIe 4.0, USB4, Thunderbolt).
✅ Advanced graphical interface (Wayland, HiDPI, Vulkan acceleration).
✅ Compatibility with Linux and Windows applications (Wine/Proton).
✅ Support for embedded systems and IoT.
✅ Native internationalization and accessibility.


🛠️ Development

If you want to contribute to the development of KERYMA-XI, follow these steps:

🔹 1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/KERYMA-XI.git
